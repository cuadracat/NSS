# NSS
Script for merging and creating more usable Stata files as per econ professor's desires, merges by creating a unique ID
NSS data available for download on Indian Sample Survey's website
This particular script is for NSS round 68 
Scripts vary between rounds as survey parameters are not consistent and variables to create a unique ID change drastically 
NSS files don't come as STATA files, and need to be converted
